LINE FOLLOWING ROBOT
This verilog code aims to implement a Line Following Robot in Hardware using the PWM generators, Motors, IR Sensors etc. This project implements a line-following robot simulation in Verilog. It consists of modules for IR sensor interfacing, logic to determine motor control signals based on sensor inputs, and PWM signal generation for motor speed control. The main module integrates these components, and the testbench verifies functionality by simulating various sensor inputs and monitoring resulting motor control signals. This setup mimics a practical scenario where the robot navigates paths based on detected lines using sensor feedback and motor adjustments.
